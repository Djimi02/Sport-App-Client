First, I will describe the purpose of the app and what it looks like. For technical information please scroll down.

NOTE: The current version of the application is just a demo and the UI is yet to be designed.

## Application purpose
TeamTally is app designed for people, who regularly play team sports with friends and would like to keep track of their game statistics.

The app allows users to create sport specific groups. Inside these groups, users can add members that represent their friends. Each member in a group has sport specific statistics. Members of a group can be associated with an app user. The creator of a group can send a code to their friends, which can be used to join their group. Upon joining, users can choose between joining the group as new (fresh) member or joining as (being associated with) an already existing member in the group. Members in a group can create games. The game creation process includes: choosing teams and setting each member's game statistics. Saving a game updates each member's statistics, for the members who participated in the game. In this way the application keeps track of the statistics per member and per game.

Visual content of the application follows.
